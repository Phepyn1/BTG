# BTG Vaccination Card System

A RESTful system for managing vaccination records.  
It allows registering people, vaccines, and vaccination entries, as well as viewing and deleting vaccination cards.

This project was developed for a [technical interview]("docs/Cartão%de%Vacinação.md") at **BTG Empresas** using **.NET 8**, **SQLite**, **EF Core**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**.

The UI design was created using **Figma AI + Figma**, following the **BTG visual language** for layout, spacing, typography, and color structure.
